        <h1>schitzwin.pl</h1>
        <h2>What Is it?</h2>
        <p>Just a very short irssi script based on hilightwin.pl (another
                irssi script) that logs your own messages (instead of
                hilighted messages) to a separate window, named
                "schitzo".</p>
        <h2>Why Did You Create It?</h2>
        <p>Its intended purpose was to help you find things that you had
                said (e.g., half an hour ago) and forgotten about. Instead
                of scrolling through a whole channel's log to find the
                message you can just scroll through your own messages.</p>
        <h2>Is It Stable?</h2>
        <p>That depends on what you call stable. I wrote it in about 15
                minutes (most of which was spent trying to figure out
                the irssi APIs) and I published this shortly after that.
                It hasn't really been tested thoroughly so I'm not sure if
                it works well or if it just serves as a distraction. The
                format of messages logged to it might benefit from
                modification to avoid you thinking that somebody you've
                private messaged said something to you instead of
                visa-versa. For example, it would sure be embarrasing to
                comment on something silly that somebody said if it was
                actually you that said it. <tt>;)</tt></p>
        <h2>Where Is The Script?</h2>
        <p>The script is now tracked on GitHub. You can find the
                repository page
                <a href="http://github.com/bamccaig/schitzwin.pl">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>Isn't Your Script Obsolete?</h2>
        <p>It very well may be. It would certainly be much easier to grep
                chat logs to find a particular message instead of
                scrolling through them reading each one. I haven't learned
                a way to do this yet so I hacked up this script instead.
                If you do know of a way to conveniently search through
                irssi windows or logs from within irssi then please let me
                know. :) You can reach me at
