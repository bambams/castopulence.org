        <csc:title>The Name "Castopulence"</csc:title>
        <csc:body>
            <p>The name "Castopulence" was thought up by Brandon McCaig
                and derives from the words "cast" and "opulence". The
                former, meaning "throw" or "launch", was partially
                inspired by the
                <a class="external"
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy">Final
                    Fantasy</a> video game series, and in particular,
                <a class="external"
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII">Final
                    Fantasy VII</a> (from casting "magic spells" through

                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28Final_Fantasy_VII%29#Materia">materia</a>).
                The latter meaning "wealth" (or "abundant supply"), which
                I guess is just something to desire.

        <csc:body>
            <p>At the moment, just a dream. <tt>^_^</tt> In the future,
                we're hoping to someday become an official non-profit
                organization that develops

                need to figure out how to either make a living doing it
                or find enough free time to make it happen outside of
                employment.</p>
