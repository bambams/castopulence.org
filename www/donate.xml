            The date might be a good application for an imported XSL
            document if I can figure out XSL to transform a date into a
            string like 'Three hours ago' when the date is less than a
            given unit, etc.

            <p>Currently we don't feel we're working on anything worthy of
            donations (not all projects listed on the project page are
            being actively developed yet) so there is currently no way to
            donate. If you <em>really</em> want to anyway (maybe you don't
            like money and want to get rid of it) you can <a
                href="contact">contact us</a> to
            find out how. <tt>;)</tt></p>
