          <p>rot is a simple little console application that implements
                arbitrary rotation-based ciphers on textual streams. It
                supports rot13 and rot47, and is flexible enough to
                support many custom ciphers as well, based on the same
                rules of defining character ranges to rotate a given
                number of characters.</p>
          <p>The code was originally written in Cygwin, a UNIX-like
                environment for Windows, though it should be mostly
                cross-platform. The current repository only has a
                rudimentary <del>shell script</del><ins>Makefile</ins>
                to build it, however, so if your platform doesn't support
                the <del>shell script</del><ins>Makefile</ins> (or it
                just doesn't work properly on your platform) then you may
                have to build it manually. If it's of any use to you then
                you probably already know how to do this. If not, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and motivate us to
                write a platform independent <span class="filesystem-path">Makefile</span>, release a
                binary build for your platform, or at least provide you
                with some guidance for building one yourself.</p>

          <p>Myt is intended to be a secure messaging platform that
                fights spam through encryption and server communication.
                Far from being complete (at the time of the writing there
                is basically just a stub application with proposed command
                line options), it is merely a proposal based on the
                frustration of being unable to hand out E-mail addresses
                at will. Myt would support both E-mail and instant
                messaging facilities to start. Extended functionality,
                like voice/video chat may follow, but that's looking a
                long way into the future.</p>
          <p>Firstly, Myt would guarantee a secure connection (or at
                least each connection would be encrypted). This means that
                messages sent through Myt should be able to safely
                contain things like passwords or personal information
                (though just because it <em>could</em> doesn't mean it
                <em>has</em> to).</p>
          <p>Secondly, Myt would hold hosts responsible for the messages
                they send. In particular, when a Myt server receives a
                message, it will contact the alleged sender to request
                confirmation that they actually sent the message on behalf
                of the specified user. If the server doesn't confirm
                sending it then the message is discarded before the user
                is even aware of it. This should help to prevent spoofing
                of the sender.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, Myt would maintain a network of whitelisted and
                blacklisted servers and users, managed by a peered
                network of trusted servers, to help automatically block
                messages from known spammers across the entire network.
                If user <em>A</em> on server <em>B</em> flags a message
                from user <em>C</em> on server <em>D</em> then it would
                log the event by user, server, and message; and
                communicate the event to a centralized network. Given a
                certain threshold of reports, the message would become
                automatically flagged as spam and filtered appropriately.
                Similarly, given enough reported spam messages from a
                particular user or host, the respective user or host would
                find themselves flagged as spammers across the network and
                respectively blacklisted.</p>
          <p>In addition to the server managed lists, users could also
                maintain their own lists. Either a blacklist, or perhaps
                more conveniently, a <em>whitelist</em>. What this means
                is that merely having an E-mail address would be
                insufficient for actually contacting a user. They would
                need to have explicitly allowed communication from you
                first. This would cut down on spam because it requires a
                mutual desire to communicate between nodes.</p>
          <p>Consider, for example, the very regular occurrence of Web
                site registrations that require a valid E-mail address.
                You don't really want to provide that information because
                for all you know the Web site will share the information,
                often for money, with third parties that will then spam
                you. With a whitelist based model, they would have to
                explicitly tell you each and every address that they
                intend to contact you with. You can easily filter them
                because you know exactly what they are. At the very first
                sign of spam, you can also easily remove the address from
                the whitelist, essentially revoking their privileges to
                contact you.</p>
          <p>Myt is mostly just an informal proposal right now. It's
                a work in progress. If you have ideas or concerns, feel
                free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to let us know

          <p>This "project" is currently just in the idea stage.
                Essentially, the goal is to develop a package format based
                on open technologies (XML, tar, gzip or xz). Then create a
                package manager application for the major desktop platforms
                (Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X; others of course can
                follow).</p>
          <p>The package would be installed by following a set of
                reversible instructions inside of a [valid] XML file. The
                uninstall process would be determined by reversing the
                installation instructions (and hopefully guaranteed to
                succeed).</p>
          <p>If something doesn't work properly though, the package
                itself would be a simple compressed archive and plaintext
                XML. You could easily open it up and see what it's trying
                to do (or undo) and do it yourself.</p>
          <p>For efficiency's sake, platforms that have disorganized
                file system structures (i.e., Windows) would use an
                organized hierarchy within the mess. For example,
                something like this:</p>
          <ul>
                <li>
                    C:\Program Files\<em>PROJECTROOT</em>\
                    <ul>
                        <li>bin <em>(for executables, single path added to
                            <span class="env">PATH</span>)</em></li>
                        <li>include <em>(for C/C++ header files)</em></li>
                        <li>lib <em>(for static and/or shared
                            libraries)</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
          <p>The XML file that describes the installation process would
                use built in 'commands' that are considered safe and
                automatically reversible (this may require version control
                to manage previous states). Using standard packages would
                allow users to have confidence in the package. They can
                easily open it up and see what it does and trust that it
                can only do safe things. This concept will probably break
                with source packages though. Even then, however, the hope
                is that the XML can describe the build process in a safe
                and platform-independent way (without referring to any
                specific system commands) so that the process is somewhat
                controlled.</p>
          <p>Unsafe packages would be supported that are free to do
                whatever they want, but the package manager would require
                explicit options from the user to allow them. They'd
                otherwise fail with an ugly error message.</p>
          <p>As you can see, it's a very informal mess of ideas right
                now. <tt>:P</tt></p>
